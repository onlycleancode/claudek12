          The two variables that produce successful outcomes are the right
          people and the right processes. There are engineers who could have
          coded a better site (kinda obvious), K-12 teachers and admins who know
          more about the day-to-day struggles, and life-long K-12 professionals
          who understand the policy side of things better. My strength is in my
          ability to be the glue, quickly assessing and enabling people to be
          positioned to do their best work. Most of enabling people to do their
          work is clean, simple processes that ensure people are never blocked
          by a form or approval. I&apos;m a big believer in &ldquo;just
          build&rdquo; but understand that we cannot be *that* aggressive when
          dealing with an industry as critical as K-12 education, especially
          when many students and parents &ldquo;aren&apos;t asking for
          it.&rdquo;

          I&apos;m hesitant to call education &ldquo;broken&rdquo; because
          it&apos;s never been ideal. We&apos;ve had to fit into a mold forever,
          I took standardized tests that are apparently useless now and replaced
          by something else. AI is the first time we can scale the
          &ldquo;right&rdquo; education methods for each student. The cliche of
          teaching a fish to climb can die out with these innovations. At the
          same time we need to be careful, there is still value in a
          standardized way of assessment and of powering through the mundane
          material. This is a balance we would work hard to get right by
          co-building the solution with educators, students, and parents.
